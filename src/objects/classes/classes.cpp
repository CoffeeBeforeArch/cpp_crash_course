  // Classes have access specifiers that say who is allowed to access which
  // data/functions
  // Private says this can only be accessed by members/friends of this class
  // (more on friends later)
  // The default access specifier for classes is private
 private:
  // Classes can have fields (data members)

  // We can have methods for printing

  // We can print out our custom string just by calling the method
  // This will use the values in our object
